I arrived on Monday and spent the afternoon exploring the city a bit, then met some of the conference attendees for dinner. On Tuesday there was the actual <a href=\"https://apithedocs.org/paris2018\">API the Docs</a> conference day at the beautiful Mozilla office. There were interesting speakers and more nice and interesting people to talk to. I’ve started writing a blog post about the event and the talks which I’ll publish on the CloudObjects Blog soon. This morning before leaving I went to see <a href=\"http://stationf.co/\">STATION F</a>, the world’s largest startup campus, located in Paris.</p>\n",
