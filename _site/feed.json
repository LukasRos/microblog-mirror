			"content_html": "<p>As you may be aware, I’m interested in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income\">Universal Basic Income (UBI)</a>. I believe that it is a useful policy for developed countries to counteract the adverse effects of increased automation and flexibility that leads to less job security. At the same time, I also believe that cash transfers, especially if issued as basic income (what <a href=\"https://givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a> does), are an effective mechanism for foreign aid.</p>\n\n<p>A while ago, I came across an exciting project called <strong>MannaBase</strong>. Founded initially as <em>GrantCoin</em>, MannaBase marries the basic income idea with a cryptocurrency. Their concept is that everyone can sign up and receive an equal share of the currency. As it’s a cryptocurrency, people can trade Manna at online exchanges, and that’s how the new money gains value.</p>\n\n<p>What I also like a lot about them is that the <a href=\"https://www.peoplescurrency.org/\">People’s Currency foundation</a> that issues Manna has plans to build direct giving instruments directly into the platform so that income recipients can redirect parts of their share to people in need based on demographics.</p>\n\n<p>The only downside to Manna that I see is that it’s a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system\">proof-of-work</a> cryptocurrency, which are known to be inefficient. That is something that they, just like everyone else in the cryptocurrency space, has to solve if they want to reach mainstream adoption, but the first steps (such as proof-of-stake or lightning networks) have already been made.</p>\n\n<p>As of now, the weekly distribution has a value of around a single cent, but a project like this is a long shot aimed at the future. Also, to grow the community, MannaBase has a referral program!</p>\n\n<p>So, if you also find this is an inspiring idea, why not <a href=\"https://www.mannabase.com/?ref=0fd3f2f990\">sign up for MannaBase with my referral link</a> and collect 50% more Manna for a year?! I’d appreciate that :)</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter recently announced the <a href=\"https://datatransferproject.dev/\">Data Transfer Project</a> (DTP) as a way to improve data portability between different services. Naturally, I was intrigued to understand what precisely the DTP is. So I spend a recent ride on the train riding <a href=\"https://datatransferproject.dev/dtp-overview.pdf\">the whitepaper</a> and will give you a little summary here:</p>\n\n<p>DTP provides <a href=\"https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project\">a Java-based, Docker-deployable open source application</a> that executes bulk tasks with the following workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Authenticate with providers via OAuth.</li>\n  <li>Export data from one provider through their API and, if necessary, convert it to a standard data model via adapters. Providers can write their own adapters, or third parties can contribute and share them as part of the open source project.</li>\n  <li>Temporarily store data in encrypted form.</li>\n  <li>Import data into another provider using their API after, if necessary, converting the standard data model back into the provider-specific format.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A running instance of DTP is called a host. There are different possible models for hosts. One option (<em>distributed</em>) is that a provider itself runs a DTP that allows import from and export to a list of other providers of their choosing. The second option (<em>centralized</em>) is a third party that hosts the infrastructure to exchange data between different providers. The DTP whitepaper suggests that Data Portability NGOs could run such an instance. Finally, the third option (<em>self-managed</em>) means end users are running their own DTP instance.</p>\n\n<p>The DTP only provides software and doesn’t specify any requirements for providers as to with who they have to interact. Every host decides which adapters it makes available and needs to apply for API access with each provider. Also, the whole design of the DTP is for one-time data transfer and does not support continuous synchronization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My opinion:</strong> The DTP is convincing and can certainly help with data portability. Of course, it depends on providers opening up their APIs, although consumer demand and data portability requirements (as in the GDPR) could drive them. Its scope is limited, but I think its data models could be applied even outside this scope for federation and interoperability (or they could become <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">“just another standard …”</a>).</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I came across <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1520156881/openbook-the-honest-open-source-and-awesome-social\">the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Openbook</a>. They call themselves “The honest, open-source &amp; awesome social network”, and their plan is to build a “Facebook competitor” that is open sourced, free of advertisements, and wants to donate a portion of their revenue to charity - but apparently is not decentralized or federated.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure what to think about it. On the one hand, I believe we need more alternatives to Facebook, except then I remember that the problem is not that other options don’t exist, but that network effects work against them. It’s already difficult for social media to grow through some hype, venture capital, and unique features. Being “Facebook, but open” is a tough value proposition to sell. I still wish them luck. Their design mocks look fine, and the team also seems solid; they have a founder of PGP on board as well as some non-technical people that could help make Openbook something that doesn’t just cater to computer geeks.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I saw the documentary <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5033790/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Banking on Bitcoin</a> last night. The main reason I watched it was that they hosted a screening at this very nice co-working/co-living place called <a href=\"http://theroof.io/\">The Roof</a> here in Las Palmas. \nRegarding the movie itself, it’s obviously outdated since it’s from 2016 and a lot has happened in the cryptocurrency space since then.</p>\n\n<p><em>What I liked about it</em>: it does a good job demonstrating the beginnings of Bitcoin from the cypherpunk movement, the first startups in the space and their regulation issues as well as the search for the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. From that perspective, I can highly recommend it.</p>\n\n<p><em>What I didn’t like about it:</em> the movie contains practically no criticism. Issues like scalability are glossed over, and others like the inefficient use of energy are not mentioned at all. You end up thinking that Bitcoin is without a doubt this great technology that just has to go through growing pains.</p>\n",
