Social networks have brought people together but have also been detrimental to privacy. Their broad reach and algorithms have helped with the Arab Spring but also with Donald Trump and Brexit. Smartphones require materials that are often mined by child labor. Data centers draw vast amounts of energy.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago I listed to <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/anne-currie-of-container-solutions-talks-ethics/\">an episode from The New Stack podcast</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anne_e_currie\">Anne Curie</a> of the cloud consulting company <a href=\"https://container-solutions.com/\">Container Solutions</a>. Together with London-based diversity-focussed programming meetup <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Coed-Code/\">Coed:Code</a>, she organized a conference called <a href=\"https://www.coedethics.org/\">Coed:Ethics</a> to talk about the impact of the technology industry and what we as professionals should do.</p>\n\n<p>As she told in the podcast, they wanted to produce some tangible results from the conference, and for that, the UN development goals were an inspiration because they offer a low common denominator that is entirely noncontroversial so that everybody can agree on them.</p>\n\n<p>The result is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCCb3rgqtQxcRwLdTr0P_hCK_drIZrm1Dpb4dlPeG6M/edit\">a whitepaper about the state of data center energy usage in 2018</a>, which is at roughly 2% of the entire global energy usage, and <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/sustainable-servers-by-2024\">a petition</a> to hosters and cloud providers with a simple goal: run all servers with 100% renewable energy in 2024!</p>\n\n<p>I like this goal, and I’ve already <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/sustainable-servers-by-2024\">signed the petition, and I recommend you do the same</a>. There’s less than 1000 signatures so far - I think we can do much better! Also, I believe the ecological footprint is an excellent way to start a discussion about the ethics of the tech industry before we move to more controversial topics such as privacy.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>A month ago <a href=\"https://lukasrosenstock.net/2018/08/11/as-you-may.html\">I had written about Manna</a>, the cryptocurrency that is issued as a Universal Basic Income (UBI). It was <a href=\"https://www.usv.com/blog/an-overview-of-blockchain-based-universal-basic-income-projects\">an article in the Union Square Ventures (USV) blog</a> that caused me to sign up for their service. The list that USV compiled contained a few more intriguing projects but, to get started, I wanted to experiment with only one. A few days ago I came across <a href=\"https://safehaven.com/cryptocurrencies/alt-coins/Universal-Basic-Income-Is-This-The-Crypto-End-Game.html\">another interesting article about the intersection of cryptocurrencies and UBI</a>, which listed only two examples, Manna and <strong>Swift</strong> (which was also in the USV list). So I decided to sign up for Swift as well.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between Manna and Swift is that Manna already uses the blockchain while Swift is a centralized digital currency whose blockchain is under development. As far as its website goes, Swift looks a bit more advanced at the moment, for example, it has a complete shop and an API to build transactions around the system. Another critical difference is that Manna will automatically come to your account once a week whereas Swift comes daily but you need to claim it actively and, if unclaimed, new income payments expire after seven days. That means, if you want to use and collect Swift, you should sign in to their website at least once a week. It could be a crucial feature, though, to drive actual adoption and keep the currency valuable instead of having a large number of non-active accounts (“Karteileichen”) holding the coin.</p>\n\n<p>There’s also a referral program, so if you want to try it, <a href=\"https://www.swiftdemand.com/?referred_by=lukasros\">please sign up with my link</a>. I’m curious how this space will develop. If I find the time I will play around with the API and offer some services in their shop.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>As you may be aware, I’m interested in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income\">Universal Basic Income (UBI)</a>. I believe that it is a useful policy for developed countries to counteract the adverse effects of increased automation and flexibility that leads to less job security. At the same time, I also believe that cash transfers, especially if issued as basic income (what <a href=\"https://givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a> does), are an effective mechanism for foreign aid.</p>\n\n<p>A while ago, I came across an exciting project called <strong>MannaBase</strong>. Founded initially as <em>GrantCoin</em>, MannaBase marries the basic income idea with a cryptocurrency. Their concept is that everyone can sign up and receive an equal share of the currency. As it’s a cryptocurrency, people can trade Manna at online exchanges, and that’s how the new money gains value.</p>\n\n<p>What I also like a lot about them is that the <a href=\"https://www.peoplescurrency.org/\">People’s Currency foundation</a> that issues Manna has plans to build direct giving instruments directly into the platform so that income recipients can redirect parts of their share to people in need based on demographics.</p>\n\n<p>The only downside to Manna that I see is that it’s a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system\">proof-of-work</a> cryptocurrency, which are known to be inefficient. That is something that they, just like everyone else in the cryptocurrency space, has to solve if they want to reach mainstream adoption, but the first steps (such as proof-of-stake or lightning networks) have already been made.</p>\n\n<p>As of now, the weekly distribution has a value of around a single cent, but a project like this is a long shot aimed at the future. Also, to grow the community, MannaBase has a referral program!</p>\n\n<p>So, if you also find this is an inspiring idea, why not <a href=\"https://www.mannabase.com/?ref=0fd3f2f990\">sign up for MannaBase with my referral link</a> and collect 50% more Manna for a year?! I’d appreciate that :)</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter recently announced the <a href=\"https://datatransferproject.dev/\">Data Transfer Project</a> (DTP) as a way to improve data portability between different services. Naturally, I was intrigued to understand what precisely the DTP is. So I spend a recent ride on the train riding <a href=\"https://datatransferproject.dev/dtp-overview.pdf\">the whitepaper</a> and will give you a little summary here:</p>\n\n<p>DTP provides <a href=\"https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project\">a Java-based, Docker-deployable open source application</a> that executes bulk tasks with the following workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Authenticate with providers via OAuth.</li>\n  <li>Export data from one provider through their API and, if necessary, convert it to a standard data model via adapters. Providers can write their own adapters, or third parties can contribute and share them as part of the open source project.</li>\n  <li>Temporarily store data in encrypted form.</li>\n  <li>Import data into another provider using their API after, if necessary, converting the standard data model back into the provider-specific format.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A running instance of DTP is called a host. There are different possible models for hosts. One option (<em>distributed</em>) is that a provider itself runs a DTP that allows import from and export to a list of other providers of their choosing. The second option (<em>centralized</em>) is a third party that hosts the infrastructure to exchange data between different providers. The DTP whitepaper suggests that Data Portability NGOs could run such an instance. Finally, the third option (<em>self-managed</em>) means end users are running their own DTP instance.</p>\n\n<p>The DTP only provides software and doesn’t specify any requirements for providers as to with who they have to interact. Every host decides which adapters it makes available and needs to apply for API access with each provider. Also, the whole design of the DTP is for one-time data transfer and does not support continuous synchronization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My opinion:</strong> The DTP is convincing and can certainly help with data portability. Of course, it depends on providers opening up their APIs, although consumer demand and data portability requirements (as in the GDPR) could drive them. Its scope is limited, but I think its data models could be applied even outside this scope for federation and interoperability (or they could become <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">“just another standard …”</a>).</p>\n",

They call themselves “The honest, open-source &amp; awesome social network”, and their plan is to build a “Facebook competitor” that is open sourced, free of advertisements, and wants to donate a portion of their revenue to charity - but apparently is not decentralized or federated.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure what to think about it. On the one hand, I believe we need more alternatives to Facebook, except then I remember that the problem is not that other options don’t exist, but that network effects work against them. It’s already difficult for social media to grow through some hype, venture capital, and unique features. Being “Facebook, but open” is a tough value proposition to sell. I still wish them luck. Their design mocks look fine, and the team also seems solid; they have a founder of PGP on board as well as some non-technical people that could help make Openbook something that doesn’t just cater to computer geeks.</p>\n",
