			"content_html": "<p>I came across <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1520156881/openbook-the-honest-open-source-and-awesome-social\">the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Openbook</a>. They call themselves “The honest, open-source &amp; awesome social network”, and their plan is to build a “Facebook competitor” that is open sourced, free of advertisements, and wants to donate a portion of their revenue to charity - but apparently is not decentralized or federated.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure what to think about it. On the one hand, I believe we need more alternatives to Facebook, except then I remember that the problem is not that other options don’t exist, but that network effects work against them. It’s already difficult for social media to grow through some hype, venture capital, and unique features. Being “Facebook, but open” is a tough value proposition to sell. I still wish them luck. Their design mocks look fine, and the team also seems solid; they have a founder of PGP on board as well as some non-technical people that could help make Openbook something that doesn’t just cater to computer geeks.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Machine-readable API specification formats like OpenAPI are not just for creating documentation but can be a driver for the whole API lifecycle. If you generate them from code you’re leaving half of what OpenAPI can do on the table, so it’s better to develop a specification-first API workflow.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote about this topic as a guest post for Stoplight who offer cloud-based tools around OpenAPI and API design. You can <a href=\"https://blog.stoplight.io/openapi-and-design-first-principles-96e7c4b2aec1\">read it in the Stoplight API Corner on Medium</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclosure: This work was paid for by Stoplight.</em></p>\n",

These two weeks were a great experience but also way too short; as I had a lot of work to do I couldn’t explore as much of the city or the island as I wanted to. So, sooner or later, I have to go there again!</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I saw the documentary <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5033790/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Banking on Bitcoin</a> last night. The main reason I watched it was that they hosted a screening at this very nice co-working/co-living place called <a href=\"http://theroof.io/\">The Roof</a> here in Las Palmas. \nRegarding the movie itself, it’s obviously outdated since it’s from 2016 and a lot has happened in the cryptocurrency space since then.</p>\n\n<p><em>What I liked about it</em>: it does a good job demonstrating the beginnings of Bitcoin from the cypherpunk movement, the first startups in the space and their regulation issues as well as the search for the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. From that perspective, I can highly recommend it.</p>\n\n<p><em>What I didn’t like about it:</em> the movie contains practically no criticism. Issues like scalability are glossed over, and others like the inefficient use of energy are not mentioned at all. You end up thinking that Bitcoin is without a doubt this great technology that just has to go through growing pains.</p>\n",
