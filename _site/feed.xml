        <description>&lt;p&gt;As promised, I wrote an article about my experience at API the Docs Paris 2018. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudobjects.io/api-documentation/events/2018/05/04/api-the-docs-paris/&quot;&gt;published on the CloudObjects blog&lt;/a&gt;. Looking forward to your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on a train on my way back home from Paris, where I had three great days! I arrived on Monday and spent the afternoon exploring the city a bit, then met some of the conference attendees for dinner. On Tuesday there was the actual &lt;a href=&quot;https://apithedocs.org/paris2018&quot;&gt;API the Docs&lt;/a&gt; conference day at the beautiful Mozilla office. There were interesting speakers and more nice and interesting people to talk to. I’ve started writing a blog post about the event and the talks which I’ll publish on the CloudObjects Blog soon. This morning before leaving I went to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://stationf.co/&quot;&gt;STATION F&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s largest startup campus, located in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that not only will I be attending &lt;a href=&quot;https://apithedocs.org/paris2018&quot;&gt;API the Docs in Paris on April 24th&lt;/a&gt;, but my talk proposal &lt;a href=&quot;https://apithedocs.org/node/152&quot;&gt;“To SDK or not to SDK?”&lt;/a&gt; has been accepted by the conference committee.
Currently I’m working on the talk and look very much forward to giving it in Paris soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After long consideration, I decided to create a hosted Microblog on micro.blog. Now I need to set this thing up.&lt;/p&gt;
