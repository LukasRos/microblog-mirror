  <p>I saw the documentary <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5033790/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Banking on Bitcoin</a> last night. The main reason I watched it was that they hosted a screening at this very nice co-working/co-living place called <a href="http://theroof.io/">The Roof</a> here in Las Palmas. 
Regarding the movie itself, it’s obviously outdated since it’s from 2016 and a lot has happened in the cryptocurrency space since then.</p>

<p><em>What I liked about it</em>: it does a good job demonstrating the beginnings of Bitcoin from the cypherpunk movement, the first startups in the space and their regulation issues as well as the search for the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. From that perspective, I can highly recommend it.</p>

<p><em>What I didn’t like about it:</em> the movie contains practically no criticism. Issues like scalability are glossed over, and others like the inefficient use of energy are not mentioned at all. You end up thinking that Bitcoin is without a doubt this great technology that just has to go through growing pains.</p>
