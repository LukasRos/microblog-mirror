Security is an often overlooked aspect of API design. In another guest post for my client [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io) I have written about the different elements of API security and how the [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/) allows you to define authentication and authorization for your API explicitly, but also how a specification-driven workflow helps with security in general.

You can read [my API security in OpenAPI article in the Stoplight API Corner on Medium](https://blog.stoplight.io/api-security-in-openapi-b105ae725a08).
