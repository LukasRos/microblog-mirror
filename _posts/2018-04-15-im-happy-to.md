I'm happy to announce that not only will I be attending [API the Docs in Paris on April 24th](https://apithedocs.org/paris2018), but my talk proposal ["To SDK or not to SDK?"](https://apithedocs.org/node/152) has been accepted by the conference committee.
Currently I'm working on the talk and look very much forward to giving it in Paris soon.
