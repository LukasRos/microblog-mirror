I'm on a train on my way back home from Paris, where I had three great days! I arrived on Monday and spent the afternoon exploring the city a bit, then met some of the conference attendees for dinner. On Tuesday there was the actual [API the Docs](https://apithedocs.org/paris2018) conference day at the beautiful Mozilla office. There were interesting speakers and more nice and interesting people to talk to. I've started writing a blog post about the event and the talks which I'll publish on the CloudObjects Blog soon. This morning before leaving I went to see [STATION F](http://stationf.co/), the world's largest startup campus, located in Paris.
