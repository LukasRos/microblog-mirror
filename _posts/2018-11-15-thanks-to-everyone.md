Thanks to everyone who was at my talk _Specification-driven API vs. Technical Writers_. If you want to refresh your memory or if you haven't been at the talk but still interested in the topic you can now [get my deck on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/LukasRos/specificationdriven-api-design-vs-technical-writers).
