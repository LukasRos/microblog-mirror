Machine-readable API specification formats like OpenAPI are not just for creating documentation but can be a driver for the whole API lifecycle. If you generate them from code you're leaving half of what OpenAPI can do on the table, so it's better to develop a specification-first API workflow.

I wrote about this topic as a guest post for Stoplight who offer cloud-based tools around OpenAPI and API design. You can [read it in the Stoplight API Corner on Medium](https://blog.stoplight.io/openapi-and-design-first-principles-96e7c4b2aec1).
