For APIs to be successful, it's important that they are functionally correct and that they perform well. Testing is a wide field with a lot of different approaches and terminology surrounding them, and it's also connected to other aspects of the API lifecycle such as monitoring. I have researched and explained some of **the major aspects of API testing** and I wrote an article about this. You can read it [on the BlazeMeter blog](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/api-performance-testing-scenarios-and-vocabulary) or [the syndicated copy on DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/api-performance-testing-scenarios-and-vocabulary).
