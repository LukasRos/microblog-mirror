I'm at this year's [tekom conference and fair](https://conferences.tekom.de/tcworld18/), also known as **tcworld18**, and I'm about to give a talk titled _Specification-driven API vs. Technical Writers_. If you found my website because of it, welcome! The slides will be published by tekom after the conference but I will also share them on this site soon.
