Tonight I will be at the [bits, bytes & bier #3 meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/bits-bytes-bier/events/254301085/) in the _FinTecSystems_ office in Linden near Gie√üen and give a talk called _Specification-driven API Design with OpenAPI_. It will be similar to last week's talk, but since it's a meetup targeted at developer, there will be an emphasis on the OpenAPI specification and less about documentation and the role of technical writers.
