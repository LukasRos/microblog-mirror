I've observed that sometimes people use the words "API" and "microservice" and mean the same thing, or they use the terms in other confusing ways. As the famous adage goes, "there's only two hard problems in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things", and it seems to be correct when it comes to terminology in the API ecosystem.

I'm exploring these terms, along with containers, in an article _APIs and Microservices_ that now got the more click-baity editorial headline ["Stop Calling your APIs Microservices"](https://blog.stoplight.io/stop-calling-your-apis-microservices-e165a80eba9d) and has been published in [the Stoplight API Corner on Medium](https://blog.stoplight.io/stop-calling-your-apis-microservices-e165a80eba9d). Go and check it out!
