You have never created a machine-readable API specification with OpenAPI because you didn't know how to start?! Lucky for you, I've written a practical tutorial that does a little hand-holding and takes you step-by-step through your first OpenAPI file. It uses [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)'s visual editor, so you don't have to code it in YAML or JSON manually, but I also show you how it looks like under the hood, so you better understand how OpenAPI works.

You can [find my tutorial in the Stoplight API Corner on Medium](https://blog.stoplight.io/getting-started-with-api-design-using-stoplight-and-openapi-90fc8f37ac2e).

_Disclosure: This work was paid for by Stoplight._
