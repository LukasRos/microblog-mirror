I'm on a train right now on my way to London. I'll be attending the [API the Docs London 2018](https://apithedocs.org/london2018) conference and the first [DevPortal Awards Gala](https://devportalawards.org/), where I have the honor to announce the jury winner for the best overall developer portal on behalf of [the jury members](https://devportalawards.org/jury). This is also a memorable trip because it's my first time going to London by [Eurostar](https://www.eurostar.com/) and also probably the last time that this journey doesn't involve crossing the borders of the EU.
