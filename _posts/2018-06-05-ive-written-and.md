I've written and published an article, in which I describe how to create API test cases in [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and then run them both within Postman as well as its command line companion Newman and finally export the collection from Postman and import it to BlazeMeter for cloud-based functional API testing.

If you're curious you can read the article [on the BlazeMeter blog](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/api-functional-testing-with-postman-newman-blazemeter) or the [syndicated copy on DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/functional-api-testing-with-postman-newman-and-bla).

_Disclosure: This work was paid for by BlazeMeter._
